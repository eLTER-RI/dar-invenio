## Description
### Definition
Type of asset based on the list of the eLTER Standard Observations.
### Multiplicity
1
### Required
true
### Enumeration
based on the list of eLTER Standard Observations --> https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/en/

For the current implementation the following 6 eLTER Standard Observations are implemented as enumeration (name & url):
"SOGEO_001 Soil inventory – geological characterization" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/001)
"SOATM_027 Meteorology" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/027)
"SOBIO_017 Vegetation composition" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/017)
"SOBIO_096 Surface water – Algae" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/096)
"SOHYD_004 Physical/chemical characteristics standing waters" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/004) 
"SOHYD_168 Soil water content and temperature" (https://vocabs.lter-europe.net/so/168)
"Other"
